This software project is a traditional supermarket billing system with some
added functionality. It is a simple C++ project implemented using the basic
concept of object oriented Programming. Supermarkets are the place where
customers come to purchase their daily use products and pay for that, so we
need to calculate how many products were purchased by the customer and
generate the bill for the customer. In implementation of this project I used two
users.
Namely 1)Customer
2) Administrator
As it is a menu driven program the main menu has 2 menu customers and
admin.
In the Customers Menu all the products were shown in the list. Customers will
select which product he/she is going to buy and enter the quantity of each
product. Then this program will calculate the total amount and generate the
invoice according to their purchase item.
Whereas In Admin Menu, Admin has authority to
EXPLAIN ALL POINTS IN 2,3 SENTENCES
1)Create Product
2)display all product in details
3)query on each product
4)modify product
5)delete Product
6)view Product Menu
This program has a product class with data members like product number,
name, price, quantity, discount and also has member functions like create
product, show product,return product no etc.
At the time of creation of product or modifying products, product details are
stored in a binary file. At the time of deletion of products, product details of the
particular product are erased from the file.
